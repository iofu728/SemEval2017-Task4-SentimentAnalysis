\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce two deep-learning sentiment analysis model. FastText is the best way in our jobs on the embedding layer. Both TextCNN and work well in this task than traditional mechanical learning. And Bert can get more information on context. The pad position also has some effect on this model. We achieve a 69.39\% Recall score on Task A,  Macro-F1 is 69.91\%, accuracy is 70.03\%. Every score is better than the rank 1 in the competition. In the future, we want to combine the TextCNN with Bert. It may have a more fantastic effect.
