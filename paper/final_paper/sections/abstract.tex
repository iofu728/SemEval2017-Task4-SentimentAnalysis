In this paper, we present two deep-learning models that competed at SemEval-2017 Task 4 "Sentiment Analysis in Twitter subTask A". We used Text Convolutional Neural Network (TextCNN), on encoder end using a pre-trained word embeddings on a big collection of Twitter from RepLab 2013 Dataset. Also, we using a text processing tool build by DataStories which performs tokenization, word normalization, segmentation, and spell correction. And we also evaluation in Bert and some traditional machine learning like logistic regression(LR), Support Vector Machines(SVM). The evaluation shows that embedding, text processor is most important, and neural network model better than traditional machine learning model. We achieve a 69.39\% Recall score on Task A,  Macro-F1 is 69.91\%, accuracy is 70.03\%. Every score is better than the rank 1 in the competition. In the future, we want to combine the TextCNN with Bert.  All code is available to the research community.
